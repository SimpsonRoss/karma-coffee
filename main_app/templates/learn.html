        <p class="lead font-weight-normal">At Karma Coffee, our journey began with a simple yet powerful love for exceptional coffee and a deep commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Founded in the heart of the United States, our story is one of exploration, discovery, and sustainability.
          Our fascination with coffee's rich history and diverse flavours led us on a quest to source the finest beans from around the globe. From the lush landscapes of Columbia to the highlands of Ethiopia, the sun-kissed plantations of Brazil to the enchanting fields of Peru, we've embarked on a coffee odyssey to bring you the most exquisite and ethically sourced beans.
          </p>
          <p class="lead font-weight-normal">But our mission goes beyond delivering remarkable coffee. We believe that every sip should be a celebration of responsible practices and a nod to the communities that nurture these beans. We're proud to be champions of sustainability, working closely with local farmers to ensure fair wages, eco-friendly cultivation methods, and a thriving future for coffee-growing regions.</p>
